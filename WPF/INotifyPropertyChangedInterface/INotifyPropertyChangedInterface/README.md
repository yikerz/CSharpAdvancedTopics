1. `InitializeComponent()` initializes the components in `MainWindow.xaml`, setting up the user interface.

2. When `SumObj` is created and assigned to the DataContext, the initial values of `Num1` and `Num2` (set to "1" and "2", respectively) are reflected in the corresponding TextBox controls due to the TwoWay data binding.

3. If the user manually changes the value in the TextBox for Num1, the TwoWay binding updates the Num1 property in the `SumObj` instance.

4. Since the Num1 property is updated, and `OnPropertyChanged("Result")` is called in the setter of Num1, the Result property is recalculated, and the `PropertyChanged` event for "Result" is triggered.

5. The event notifies any subscribers (like the WPF binding system) that the "Result" property has changed.

6. The WPF binding system updates the corresponding TextBox bound to the "Result" property, reflecting the new sum.
